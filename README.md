How to Build Your Own PC 
By: Sophia Wilson 
This tutorial will educate people on how to build a PC from scratch and to show that it doesn't have to be expensive either!
The target audience of this project is for young students in either high school or college who want to be creative and build a computer on their own while saving money. They also get to choose exactly how the computer runs instead of it being chosen for them, causing them to learn more about computers in general.
