#### This tutorial will educate people on how to build a PC from scratch and to show that it doesn't have to be expensive either!
###### _The target audience of this project is for young students in either high school or college who want to be creative and build a computer on their own while saving money. They also get to choose exactly how the computer runs instead of it being chosen for them, causing them to learn more about computers in general._

### Quick Overview of the Tutorial:
#### 1. Getting Started
#### 2. Make a List
#### 3. Pick your Parts  
#### 4. Compare Prices
#### 5. Building the PC

## Getting Started!

>The best way to find out what kind of computer you want to build is by doing your research.  Companies like Dell, Toshiba, and Microsoft all have their strengths and weaknesses when it comes to certain aspects of their PC's. Building your own PC lets you decide how it should run and what you want it to do.  If you want to use the computer for gaming, a large hard drive with a good fan to support large programs will be of more consideration versus a computer used strictly for work.

## Make a List
> According to _WIRED_, the core contents of your PC will have to include:
* motherboard
    - where everything has its home: RAM, processor, where you plug in your hard drives, and SSDs
* processor
    - where the data is manufactured and processed
    - the "brain" of the computer (WIRED)  
* fan
    - your PC needs to be properly cooled down, especially if you're trying to build a gaming PC that handles large programs
* RAM
    - this temporary storage needs to be on any PC, for it helps to short-term tasks
    - consider either a faster or larger RAM depending on your needs
* power supply
    - this depends on the power required to run the PC, so you can match this with a proper charger for it
* storage
    - hard drives vs. solid-state drives = capacity vs. speed
* casing
  - Make sure it fits so you can plug ing HDMI cables, etc.

## Picking your Parts
  > This tutorial will focus on making an affordable PC, so the chosen parts will reflect a smaller budget targeted towards students.

  > I am going to go for a larger RAM, larger capacity storage, and a mid-grade processor, for these options are more practical and tend to be cheaper than others. Also, a nice casing because I want my PC to look presentable and original.

## Comparing Prices
> Buying parts for a PC can be daunting since there are thousands of options and many different vendors.  Budgeting helps figure out where you are willing to spend more money, as well as where you want to hold back a little. Strategically narrowing down your options is key.

> Below is a table comparing two prices of each part, showing the difference of price ranges for a single component on your PC.

|PC Part     | Practical Option  | Expensive Option|
|----------- |------------------|-----------------|
|Motherboard |$111 (3466 mHz)   |$358 (2666 mHz)  |
|Processor   |$92  (Ryzen 3)    |$355 (Ryzen 7)   |
|Fan         |$80  (120mm)      |$130 (135mm)     |
|RAM         |$80  (16GB)       |$175 (32GB)      |
|Power Supply|$60  (700W)       |$140 (850W)      |
|Storage     |$60  (2TB)        |$110 (5TB)       |
|Casing      |$40 (core 1000)   |$130 (CORSAIR)   |
|Total:      |$523              |$1,398           |

## Building the PC
> You're almost done! Now you have to assemble the PC so that it can become usable.  
Here are some tips to help build a PC so you can prevent making mistakes:

* Make sure there is **enough room for your fan!!** Don't let it interfere with other parts like the motherboard so the heat sink has space to breath and cool off
* Know the shape and measurements of your **case** _before_ you purchase it and assemble your parts inside it
* Your **motherboard** _has_ to be plugged into all of your devices in order for it to work
* Last but not least: start it up!
  - install a Windows processor and plug it in -- then connect a monitor to see it work!
